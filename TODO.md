ISSUES:
	23.10.2025:

	1- We should send response messages in case of missing arguments
	current: we throw an exception in case of wrong number of arguments
	expected: throw exception only if command is invalid, not supported

	2- USER command send 4 information depends on RFC standards
		<username> <hostname> <servername> <realname>
	OR	<username> <mode> <unused> <realname>.
	we should parse all parts
	current: HÃ¼srev commended out the part checks for second and third parameter
	expected: we should have 4 attributes in our Client class to store these infos
