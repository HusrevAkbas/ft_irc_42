	new commands:
		WHO - client sends when he joins a channel
		WHOIS - not sure, saw it before but dont remember when we get this command

ISSUES:
	27.10.2025:

	1- We should send response messages in case of missing arguments
	current: we throw an exception in case of wrong number of arguments
	expected: throw exception only if command is invalid, not supported

	2- USER command send 4 information depends on RFC standards. irssi in campus computers sends: <username> <hostname> <servername> <realname>
	we should parse all parts and save in client class.
	current: HÃ¼srev commended out the part checks for second and third parameter in command parser
	expected: we should have 4 attributes for all 4 infos in our Client class to store. i skip this step for now. Can you add attributes to Client?
		username, hostname, servername, realname, password

	3- After joining a channel, if we send PART command, we have a crash. Logs are here:

		free(): double free detected in tcache 2
		zsh: IOT instruction (core dumped)  ./ircserv 3333 SAFEME

	4- As you see above, when we join a channel, client sends two more commands automatically. MODE #channel and WHO #channel. we also need to implement WHO

	5- client wants to change usermod with MODE user +i, but we handle only channel modes.
